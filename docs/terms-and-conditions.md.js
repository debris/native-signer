**Stylo - Terms and Conditions**

We have tried to keep the following concise and to the point, please read on.

**Use this application offline**

Stylo is meant to be used offline. To make sure that no secret is leaked to a malicious actor please follow these steps:
- An account should be created only when the phone is offline (Airplan mode, without bluetooth, wifi or any other connectivity turned on).
- You must first factory reset the phone before you turn on any connectivity, in order to minimize the security risks.
- When you sign a transaction, the application will show you the details about the transaction whenever it is technically possible. Make sure you read, verify and understand what you are signing before showing the QR code of the signed transaction. The user is the last barrier of defence against a malicious transaction.
- Do not sign a transaction that you cannot verify.
